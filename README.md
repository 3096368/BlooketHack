Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for how you use this tool.

This is the very first Blooket hack online I believe and I'm very proud of that. Try not to spread news about this though so Blooket doesn't patch any exploits used here.

Please read the WHOLE file before reporting issues and contacting me.

Please put suggestions in my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/tPPwXqhutJ).

## How To Use
- 1. First you must download python 3.7, you can do that from [This Link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/).
- 2. Second you must download the code here on GitHub.
- 3. Third you need to extract the files from the `.zip` you downloaded.
- 4. Finally, just double click the `main.py` file.

## If There Are Issues
If there are issues make sure you are running the hack with `Python 3.7`. Most python copies should work but are not tested.

Install required packages using the `pip` command, they should autoinstall but just in case.
- Python Selenium: `pip install selenium`
- Python SeleniumWire: `pip install selenium-wire`
- Python Colorama: `pip install colorama`

Make sure that the chrome webdriver is matched with your chrome version and is in the same directory of the `main.py` file.
You can get a chrome webdriver from [HERE](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).
It's also very important the name of the webdriver is this: `chromedriver.exe`. It should be that be default but if not change the name.
