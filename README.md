Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for how you use this tool.

This is the very first Blooket hack online I believe and I'm very proud of that. Try not to spread news about this though so Blooket doesn't patch any exploits used here.

Please read the WHOLE file before reporting issues and contacting me.

## How To Use
- 1. To use this cheat you must download the code.
- 2. Download python 3.7 from this link: [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/)
- 3. Extract the downloaded code from the `.zip` file.
- 4. Double click the `main.py` file.

Other cheats are in the `otherTools` folder and can be run the same way. Just double click.

## If There Are Issues
If there are issues make sure you are running the hack with `Python 3.7`. I use `Python 3.7.7`.

Install required packages using the `pip` command, they should be installed automatically but just in case.
- Python Selenium: `pip install selenium`
- Python SeleniumWire: `pip install selenium-wire`
- Python Colorama: `pip install colorama`

Also make sure that the chrome webdriver that is matched with your chrome version.

You can get a chrome webdriver from [HERE](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).

It's also very important the name of the webdriver is this: `chromedriver.exe`. It should be that be default but if not change the name.
