Use at your own risk, accounts have been banned for using this. I am not responsible for how you use this tool.

This is the very first Blooket hack online I believe and I'm very proud of that. Try not to spread news about this though so Blooket doesn't patch any exploits used here.

## How To Use
- 1. First you must download python 3.7, you can do that from [This Link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/).
- 2. Second you must download the code here on GitHub.
- 3. Third you need to extract the files from the `.zip` you downloaded.
- 4. Finally, just double click the `main.py` file.

## If There Are Issues
If there are issues make sure you are running the hack with `Python 3.7`. Most python copies should work but are not tested.

Install required packages using the `pip` command, they should autoinstall but just in case.
- Python Selenium: `pip install selenium`
- Python SeleniumWire: `pip install selenium-wire`
- Python Colorama: `pip install colorama`

Make sure that the chrome webdriver is matched with your chrome version and is in the same directory of the `main.py` file.
You can get a chrome webdriver from [HERE](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).
It's also very important the name of the webdriver is this: `chromedriver.exe`. It should be that be default but if not change the name.
