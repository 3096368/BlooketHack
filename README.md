Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for how you use this tool.

This is the very first Blooket hack online I believe and I'm very proud of that. Try not to spread news about this though so Blooket doesn't patch any exploits used here.

Please read the WHOLE file before reporting issues and contacting me.

## How To Use
- 1. To use this cheat you must download the code.
- 2. Open command prompt and change to working directory.
- 3. Type `python main.py` to run the hack.
- 4. Enter the game pin and the name you want to go by.
- 5. Run and wait. When the program prompts, press enter.

## If There Are Issues
If there are issues make sure you are running the hack with `Python 3.x`. I use `Python 3.7.7`.

Install required packages using the `pip` command. Here are the commands you must run to install everything required.
- Python Selenium: `pip install selenium`
- Python SeleniumWire: `pip install selenium-wire`

Also make sure that the chrome webdriver that is matched with your chrome version is in the same working directory of the `main.py` file.

You can get a chrome webdriver from [HERE](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).

It's also very important the name of the webdriver is this: `chromedriver.exe`. It should be that be default but if not change the name.

## To Report Issues
If you want to report and issue or get help please open a GitHub issue before doing anything else. Please wait at least 24 hours before contacting me personally.

#### What To Include In My Report
Please include the following if you are reporting an issue.
