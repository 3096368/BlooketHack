# One of the First Blooket Hacks Online

#### Original code by: kgsensei

## Development News:

#### New as of 9.24.21

TheFinalWillow seems to have abandon this project so I [kgsensei] have taken control of it again. I will continue to develop the Blooket Hack until I can find someone who wants to take it over or maintain it. If no one wants to I will do so myself. Thanks for your patience with this project.

## Features:

This Blooket Hack is meant to be the most powerful and useful cheat online, and it is designed to fulfill that title. It was initially developed for gold quest but has built up availability for every multiplayer mode [Hosted Modes]. It used to give you answers in the console and you would have to look over to get the current answer, however, with the latest update the console has turned into a log and the correct answer will be displayed in the website. No more need for a small Blooket Game.

## How to Use:

  - On install you do need to check the "Add to path" option when you can do so.
- Second you must download the code here on GitHub.
- Third you need to extract the files from the `.zip` file you downloaded.
- Finally, just double click the `main.py` file.
  - If it still doesn't work run these commands in command prompt: (Then run `main.py` again.)
   - `py -m pip install selenium`
   - `py -m pip install selenium-wire`
   - `py -m pip install colorama`
  - Be sure to update the `chromedriver.exe` file to the version that matches your chrome version.

If there is an issue not shown here, please feel free to join my [Discord server](http://discord.gg/BdMbFYwjEf) and ask or make a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/kgsensei/BlooketHack/issues).

#### Known bugs:

- Failure to show correct answer with duplicate text-based questions.
 - Cannot use this cheat on sets like "Flags of the World".
- Colorama dependency install issue on Linux.
 - This is a Colorama issue, I don't think I can help. :(
- Chrome-driver fails to start.
 - This could be caused by a system administrator blocking unknown executable files/applications from running, in which case I highly recommend using glixzzy's cheat instead. Though it may require some JS console experience. [Link Here](https://github.com/glixzzy/blooket-hack).
